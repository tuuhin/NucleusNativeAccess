 * DSL extension for the kotlin-native-export plugin.
 *
 * Minimal configuration needed — the plugin derives everything else
 * from the nativeMain source set automatically.
 *
 * Convention follows swift-java / swift-export patterns:
 * - Both debug and release variants are built
 * - [buildType] selects which variant the test/run tasks link against
 * - java.library.path includes both debug + release dirs (like swift-java)
